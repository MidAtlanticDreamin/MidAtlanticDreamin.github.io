Salesforce MVP, 10x Certified Salesforce Architect, working with nonprofits since 2003 and Salesforce since 2010. I primarily work with enterprise scale organizations, focusing on designing and building efficient and performant solutions that scale. Many of my projects involve fundraising systems, membership based organizations and complex multi-point integrations. 

I have served as a SME for the nonprofit cloud certification exam and am actively involved in the development of the new nonprofit cloud through the partner advisory process. Dreamforce speaker, NED organizing committee member. I'm also an advocate for open-source and community developed solutions that fix the shared problems nonprofits face. That has included 4 years leading an effort to design and built a free, open source package to better support membership organizations using Salesforce and work on a novel approach to automating testing using declarative tools.

I am passionate about delivering empathetic and joyful user experiences. I have been applying my unique blend of experiences at the intersection of people, data, technology, and organizational priorities for over 20 years. My education in psychology (B.S.) and social work (MSW) nicely complement my technical career with a focus on better human interactions with systems. I love paying it forward by giving back to Salesforce's Trailblazer Community, such as by presenting and supporting Trailblazers at Dreamin' events (which are voluntarily organized by leaders in the Salesforce community)!

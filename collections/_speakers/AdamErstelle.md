I'm a software-engineer turned into Salesforce fanatic. I've been in the ecosystem for almost 6 years, getting my feet wet in Pardot first, then broadening into Core, Data Cloud, Marketing Cloud, etc. I've also been able to create 4 AppExchange packages solving small pain points of Admins and Users alike.

I have blazed my trail in the Salesforce ecosystem starting as a Sales User in 2009, and eventually learned to become an Admin in 2016. Since, i've ventured into various roles in large and small orgs and now the owner of Tiny Feet Cloud Services, a Salesforce Consulting Partner specializing in CPQ and soon Revenue Lifecycle Management. I'm also in the Salesforce MVP Hall of Fame, an AwesomeAdmin award winner (those golden hoodie things), a Dreamforce speaker once upon a time, love a great gif and the Eagles. Go birds.

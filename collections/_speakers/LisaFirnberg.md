I've been a proud "un-certified" Salesforce administrator and business analyst on and off for 10 years, and have served the nonprofit sector at the intersection of internal operations, database implementation and information management for over 15 years. My professional passion is to “make order out of chaos” – to unravel complexity, establish consistency, and ultimately strengthen the operational foundation that allows mission-driven organizations to thrive.

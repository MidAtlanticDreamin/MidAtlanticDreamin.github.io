Salesforce admins love AppExchange apps. And, why not? They provide a boost to the native capabilities of a Salesforce org with little effort. However, many of those installed apps grow stale over time with new versions available that admins don’t even know about. Upgrading your installed packages helps you keep your org up-to-date with the latest features, reduce security risks and speed up your org by removing legacy declarative automation like workflow and processes. In this talk, you’ll learn how to automatically check if newer versions of your installed apps are available to upgrade and how to run a free security review of privately listed installed packages.

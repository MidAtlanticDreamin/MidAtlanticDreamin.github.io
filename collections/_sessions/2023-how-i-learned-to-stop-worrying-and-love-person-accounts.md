Over time, Salesforce's data model has seen multiple competing solutions to capture B2C relationships. This year, with a push to adopt Person Accounts in Nonprofit and Education Cloud, Salesforce has unequivocally signalled that Person Accounts is the B2C that it continue to build on. In this session, we will discuss how Person Accounts work, and how enabling them can impact the data model, the user interface, and how automations are built. We will go over better practices and considerations, feature gaps, and we will dispel some of the preconceptions that have earned the feature a poor reputation. We will also review the process to transform a Contact into a Person Account and vice versa.

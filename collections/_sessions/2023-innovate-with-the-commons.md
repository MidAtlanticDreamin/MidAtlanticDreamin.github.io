As a Salesforce professional, you know the struggles of facing common challenges in your daily work as an Admin, Developer, or Consultant. You're not alone --- others in the community feel the same way. When faced with a problem, you often turn to the community to find solutions and build a custom solution. Resolving these challenges can be time-consuming and require significant energy and resources that may already be stretched thin.

This session will introduce you to the Commons, a unique Salesforce program created to help members of the community join forces to build and share solutions for common challenges. It’s not just for nonprofit organizations! You’ll learn how you can contribute your skills at Community Sprint events, share ideas others can benefit from, and find community built solutions you can use at your organization today such as:

* Grassroots Mobile Survey, an offline capable survey tool for Nonprofits with field workers; 
* Sprinty’s Community Resources, a curated online library to help nonprofits find what they need to get started on Salesforce fast; 
* Summit Events App, which makes it easy for any School to build custom events in Salesforce; 
* and Declarative Lookup Rollup Summaries (DLRS) which provides a user-friendly wizard to surface information and understand relationships between different sets of data between records in Salesforce.

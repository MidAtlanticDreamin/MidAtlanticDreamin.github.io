Design has often been relegated to just UI/UX, but having a deep understanding of the key technical components of design-thinking can be a game changer for any Salesforce Architect. In our interactivesession, we will deep-dive into a real use case of how design and proper applied use of Lightning Web Components created lasting value for the user and business, while explaining how technical design concepts helped the customer site go live with a reach of over 2 million users with high lead conversion rates. 

After this session, Salesforce architects and delivery teams will be empowered with a deeper understanding of who design can accelerate user adoption, while creating scalable, flexible design solutions that are both user friendly and have a structured, personalized architecture to support the back end of your business needs.

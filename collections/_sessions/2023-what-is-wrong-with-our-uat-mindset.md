When I’ve seen UAT (User Acceptance Testing) go well, it’s because teams unite around continuously refining their testing procedures, not just getting through the list of acceptance criteria.  This is similar to what ethnographer and business coach Simon Sinek describes as choosing between “Finite Games” and “Infinite Games.”  In this workshop, learn how to shift your mindset toward the “Infinite Game” of UAT where “the players come and go, the rules are changeable, and there is no defined endpoint.”  It might sound scary to live in this abstract framework, but the reality (for me) has been liberating.  Leave this workshop with practical concepts that you can use right away to hone your UAT mindset AND methods.

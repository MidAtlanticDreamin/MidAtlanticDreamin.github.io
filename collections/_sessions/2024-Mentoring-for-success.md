"We’re living in a world where many newcomers to the Salesforce ecosystem are too focused on certifications as the surefire way to employment. We know that is not true and they are disappointed as time drags on and competition for roles is intense. Those who would serve as their mentors need to provide a holistic understanding of the real-life challenges and opportunities in the Salesforce realm.

In this session, we'll explore how to prepare emerging Salesforce enthusiasts for long and prosperous careers by offering them more than just certification advice.

We’ll discuss effective mentoring strategies to help your mentees navigate the complexities of the Salesforce profession. Learn how to impart essential skills, encourage problem-solving abilities, and provide insights into the daily life of a Salesforce professional.

By becoming a mentor who goes beyond the textbooks, you can shape the next generation of Salesforce talent, equipping them with the practical knowledge and resilience needed to excel in the ever-evolving tech industry. "

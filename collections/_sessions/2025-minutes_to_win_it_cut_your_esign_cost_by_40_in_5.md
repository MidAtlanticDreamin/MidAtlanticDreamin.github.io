Join this lively game show format, featuring other Salesforce leaders, as we laugh, commiserate, and maybe even cry about the nightmare that has become managing document workflows. We’ll share survey results that answer the real questions you and your fellow team members have, like:

- How did I end up with a eSignature bill big enough for a small car lease?
- Why do we need multiple tools to finish one contract?
- Has anyone on earth ever managed to make a merge template work on the first try?

Put your wits to the test and compete for prizes in a session that’s equal parts therapy and game show. You’ll leave with a clear understanding of the recurring issues other orgs face, how your workflows compare, and how a modern approach to document automation can finally simplify the process.

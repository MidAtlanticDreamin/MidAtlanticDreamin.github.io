Admins, Developers, BAs, Project Managers, and Salesforce enthusiasts have one big, common challenge: how do we get our users to adopt - and maybe even LOVE - Salesforce as much as we do? We are challenged to drive enthusiasm or enforcement with our user base, and most of the time, we don’t manage them, so the carrot/stick approach can be elusive. In this session, we will deliver both the theory and the practice, from Adult Learner, to Change Management, to Diffusion of Innovations, to SABWA in the virtual age, and beyond. Attendees will leave with a plan to drive Salesforce adoption in their own organization, with handouts and project plans.

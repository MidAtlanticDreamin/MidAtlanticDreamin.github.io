Salesforce requires 75% code coverage.  Just because the code is covered, doesn’t mean it’s tested.  Can you delete all of your Apex code and still see passing tests?  I’ll cover the three A’s of proper testing and unit tests for declarative functionality.  Primary aimed towards developers, this session should be understandable by anyone on a software development team.  Get your code coverage to 100%, build a comprehensive automated test suite and put yourself in a position to do real CI/CD.

Teams do their best work when all members communicate effectively. But too often people expect, and allow, developers and other technical experts to communicate poorly. Let's change that expectation! As experts we need to write and speak clearly to explain our work at the level of detail our audience needs. This session is designed to help highly technical people improve their speaking, writing, and general communication skills.

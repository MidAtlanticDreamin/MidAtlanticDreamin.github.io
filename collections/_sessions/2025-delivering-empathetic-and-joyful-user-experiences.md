Users deserve the best experiences to be productive, make informed decisions, and focus on their unique talents. Together, we’ll explore practical ways to include and delight users on their Salesforce journey. By being inclusive and intentional with change management, we can empower users throughout the strategy, design, building, training, & ongoing evolution of their Salesforce platform. Let’s also consider applying empathy, Salesforce features, and ongoing user feedback to add joy and value!

Building and deploying LWCs rapidly is a benefit, but how often have they broken on you? Jest testing is here to help! Let's discuss how to incorporate them into a modern Salesforce DevOps process.
 
Highly complex LWCs are becoming commonplace in modern Salesforce Orgs, but there is no requirement for testing them. Part of the benefit is that they can be rapidly updated and deployed as a key part of a modern full stack platform. However, as they get more complex and change rapidly, often by multiple developers, it can be very easy to deploy broken components to production. As the user-facing framework, any errors can have significant impact to functionality and data. We will highlight what a good jest test looks like, how to use them in your DevOps processes, and how to reduce errors.

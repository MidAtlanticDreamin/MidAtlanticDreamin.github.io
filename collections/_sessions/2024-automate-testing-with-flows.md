Does anybody really love spending hours clicking through your sandbox org trying to figure out if your change just broke something? This will share a novel approach to testing using a small, free package that allows you to write test scripts for any automation in your org in an autolauch flows, and then run all your test scripts in parallel with test data. 

This is NOT a demo of out of the box salesforce features, this is a new package and a brand new approach that allows declarative developers access to the same testing capabilities as apex developers. This new has not been done anywhere else in the Salesforce ecosystem.

Away go the laptops and out come the whiteboards as we learn to sort out customer and market segments. More importantly, we'll talk tactics on how to walk stakeholders through how they talk about prospects, customers, etc. before we start building multi-layered systems. I'll briefly introduce NAICS and SIC codes for those unfamiliar, talk through Market vs Customer segmentation (who they are vs who we are to them), and give some ideas for documenting for consensus before clicking on anything.

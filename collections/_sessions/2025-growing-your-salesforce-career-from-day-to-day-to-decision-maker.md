For experienced professionals in the Salesforce Community, making a switch from a role that's daily hands on to more of a leadership focus can be a tough transition. My session will cover things that I learned which helped me become a better Director, and give tips and information to others thinking about making a change.

The session will cover topics such as assessing your Salesforce org and staff, building a roadmap and creating a shared vision for success within the organization.

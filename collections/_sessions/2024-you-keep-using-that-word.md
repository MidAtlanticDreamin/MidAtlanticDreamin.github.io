The concept of \"declarative development\" often gets misunderstood in the Salesforce community, usually mistaken as just a zero-code, point-and-click approach. This session aims to clear the confusion and dive into the true essence of declarative development, and how the concept can inspire us to build Salesforce apps more intelligently and efficiently.

We'll explore the real meaning of declarative development and why it matters, debunking the myth that it's the opposite of coding. In fact, we'll reveal how coded solutions can align with declarative principles. This session will also guide you through strategies to make your Salesforce solutions genuinely declarative, emphasizing thoughtful, purpose-driven building, even with code.

Moreover, we'll discuss the importance of considering all users, especially admins, in your development approach. Drawing from real experiences from the field, this talk is designed to demystify the concept and provide actionable insights, whether you're a developer, an architect, or an admin. Join us to embrace the true spirit of 'declarative' and transform the way you approach your Salesforce projects.

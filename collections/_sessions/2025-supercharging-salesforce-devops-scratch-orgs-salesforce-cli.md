Salesforce development is evolving, and it’s time to move beyond traditional sandbox DevOps. This session explores how scratch orgs and Salesforce CLI empower developers to approach Salesforce projects like true software engineering. Scratch orgs, unlike sandboxes, are customizable, ephemeral environments that minimize configuration drift and enable faster, more reliable pipelines with version control and CI/CD. Learn how these practices improve agility, collaboration, and hybrid team workflows.

So you’ve inherited a Salesforce org that everyone says is cumbersome and confusing and no one likes it or trusts anything about it – now what? During this session we will review specific and practical strategies for assessing a stale and underutilized Salesforce org, making impactful changes, and re-energizing staff trust and enthusiasm for the system. Just like home makeover project, we’ll tackle decluttering, re-organizing, what to do with all those storage boxes in the basement (old, messy data, anyone?), and cosmetic and structural changes to help users love the home they have! Session attendees will come away with a tangible checklist of ideas and strategies they can use any time they find themselves facing a Salesforce org in need of a refresh. This session is ideally for internal Administrators at small-to-medium organizations. My industry experience and real-life examples will come from the nonprofit sector, but could certainly be applicable across industries.

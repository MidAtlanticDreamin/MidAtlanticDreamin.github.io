Ever feel limited with the rollups that come out of the box with Salesforce? With Declarative Lookup Rollup Summaries (DLRS), you can rollup and summarize anything! In this session, we will talk about what rollups are and why they are important. And we will share examples of rollups to help your users summarize and analyze data for prospect management, fundraising, grantmaking, programs, and more.

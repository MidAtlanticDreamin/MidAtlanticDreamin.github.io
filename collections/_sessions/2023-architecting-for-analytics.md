Data drives decisions. Having reliable, clean data is a goal of most organizations. However, far too often the method for retrieving, presenting and consuming this data is an afterthought for many implementations. This session will help you understand the architectural process required to provide your stakeholders with actionable analytics that can drive the business forward. We will examine data models and sources, reporting tools and processes, resources, access policies and delivery methods. Prepare yourself and your organization for the full analytics lifecycle. We will use a custom commission reporting solution as a live demo.

The sfdx command line can do some awesome stuff.  It can login to multiple systems, move metadata between orgs, run tests, export records, be used to create reports…this sounds like stuff admins do.  All too often, sfdx is focused around the developer, and doesn’t explain its usefulness to admins.  With the rise of source control and CI/CD, admins will find themselves more tightly integrated into a development team.  It’s time for admins to get into sfdx too.  In a hands on demo, we’ll use sfdx to move metadata, automate creating a hundred new fields and extract data for custom reporting.

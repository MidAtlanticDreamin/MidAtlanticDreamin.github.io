Stepping through a use case, I’ll show how to enable end users to update data table results using input fields on a single screen within Flow. The data table displays the output of a SOQL statement run within the DataFetcher component. The SOQL is updated dynamically by formulas as the end user changes the Screen Flow fields. As such, there is no need to move between screens or trigger subflows. End users can instantaneously see results for their criteria and select data table rows accordingly.

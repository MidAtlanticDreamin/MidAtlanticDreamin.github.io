MidAtlantic Dreamin' is a community-led conference for Salesforce professionals. Itâ€™s a bit like Dreamforce or World Tour, and our Salesforce user group leaders and other Salesforce professionals work to bring sessions and discussions on best practices and learning new features of Salesforce. Once a year, we bring the community together to help inspire and create new networking opportunities and help each other live and grow in the Salesforce ecosystem.

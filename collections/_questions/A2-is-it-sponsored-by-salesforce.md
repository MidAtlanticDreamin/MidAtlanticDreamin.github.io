Salesforce helps us with sponsoring some parts of the event, like swag, and helping us with a keynote speaker, but this is really the only role that they play. MidAtlantic Dreaminâ€˜ is supported by volunteers who are members on the committee, and is sponsored by other companies that are part of the Salesforce ecosystem.

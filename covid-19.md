### January 17th 2023 Update

As you likely noticed, PhillyForce did not run in 2021, or 2022. However, plans are now underway for a conference in 2023! Stay tuned for details.

### August 6th 2020 Update

Out of an abundance of caution, we are announcing the postponement of PhillyForce 2020 to 2021. While we did everything in our hand to hold the event this past May, or even later this year, we are not able to keep the event on the books this year due to continued COVID-19 health concerns, local health recommendations and guidelines from Salesforce. The 2021 event will still be in the Greater Philadelphia area.

### March 5th Update

On behalf on the committee members, we want to reach out to you regarding PhillyForce. We are monitoring the impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) in our Ohana community, since our conference will be a large gathering in a public space. Our top priority is always the health and safety of our participants, speakers and committee. Currently, there have been no scheduling changes to our event and program. We expect staff who are feeling ill to stay home and request that participants who are ill not attend our event. We will be posting further updates on this website.

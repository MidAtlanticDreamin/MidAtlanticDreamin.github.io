<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

Sessions should elevate the skills of attendees and broaden their platform knowledge with thought-provoking sessions.

Our goal is for **all** attendees, including non-Salesforce technical professionals, to increase their knowledge and raise their skill level.

Simply put, we are looking for authentic content that cuts through the buzzwords and presents compelling ideas.

## Who comes to the Conference?

Mid-Atlantic Dreamin’ is a community-led conference with a wide breadth of attendees. 

Some attendees are just beginning their journey on Trailhead, others are seasoned vets entering their second decade on the technology. Attendees represent the full breadth of the Ohana: Project Managers, Admins, Developers, and Architects. You’ll find folks from nonprofit, for-profit, and government spaces. Across that diversity, all attendees share a passion for Salesforce, crafting solutions, and helping others.

## What makes an Ideal Speaker?

Speakers know their content and are passionate about making others successful. 

We invite both experienced Salesforce professionals with practical experience analyzing requirements and building exciting features on the platform and new Salesforce professionals with a willingness to throw their ideas out there to be speakers. Speakers can be simply orators. Tech or tech-adjacent, we’re interested in you sharing your lived experience with the Ohana.

## What’s an ideal Session?

So what makes an ideal session? Simply put, awesome content.  We're looking for authentic sessions that presents compelling ideas.
What are some ideas for Talks?
We’re open to anything awesome. Really, anything. Below are some sample ideas to get you started:

* Ideas that discuss technologies related to the platform are fair game, as is the platform and its features. 
* Maybe you’re passionate about devOps and tooling, and want to share some tips.  Go for it!
* Have some ideas on how to manage donors or grants for non-profits? Awesome!
* Maybe you're a consultant and want to present a compelling case study, or tear-downs of either a successful or a failed project? Bring it on!
* Do you have some solutions to pain points admins are dealing with today? Share your ideas! 
* How about practical technical sessions? Please submit them!
* Maybe you’ve developed technical and organizational best practices, and want to share them? We’d love to hear them.

## Session Types

### Talks

Presentations are either 20 or 40 minutes. Interactive sessions are encouraged.  Talks are meant to provide actionable learning that attendees can apply after the conference. The format will be that each speaker is given a significant chunk of time to present, followed by a brief period of Q&A. 


### Workshops

Workshops are 75 minutes and offer hands-on training on a specific topic. Last year’s workshop included a Ladies Be Architects solution design session.


### 6:10 Lightning Talk

Speakers have six minutes and ten seconds for a quick demo of something fun they’ve worked on like a clever snippet of code, or a cool app they're proud of, or a pesky technical challenge they overcame. No Q&A. Just talks, a quick demo with an explanation and done.
